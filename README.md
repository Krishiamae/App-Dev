### HACKSAW RIDGE
**Desmond Dos**

	> The true story of Pfc. Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), who won the Congressional Medal of Honor 
despite refusing to bear arms during WWII on religious grounds. Doss was drafted and ostracized by fellow 
soldiers for his pacifist stance but went on to earn respect and adoration for his bravery, selflessness 
and compassion after he risked his life -- without firing a shot -- to save 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa.
